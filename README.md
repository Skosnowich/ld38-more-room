# More Room! (LD38-Game)

## Theme: A Small World

## Description:

This is our entry for the gamejam Ludum Dare 38.
You can find it [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/more-room).

Many comments and the documentations in the code (if there is some) are german, sorry if you don't understand them.

Everything in the package `de.skosnowich.libgdx` was made before the Ludum Dare.
That is our framework we use for Ludum Dare entries, normally they reside in other projects.
For the simplification we merged everything into this project.

Of course the code is not very clean, it is a gamejam-entry after all.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask (the fastest way is over [Twitter @Skosnowich](https://twitter.com/Skosnowich/)).
